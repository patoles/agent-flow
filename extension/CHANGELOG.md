# Changelog

## 0.6.0

- Standalone web app — run Agent Flow in the browser without VS Code (`pnpm run dev`)
- pnpm workspace monorepo setup
- VS Code debug and dev configuration
- Fix: event loss from React strict mode double-invocation
- Fix: SSE relay security hardening (localhost-only binding, restricted CORS, bounded event buffer)

## 0.5.0

- Fix: heavy performance degradation during long sessions with many agents (#20)
  - Decouple canvas rendering from React state — canvas reads from a ref at 60fps, React re-renders only on data changes
  - Virtualize transcript and message feed panels for constant render cost regardless of message count
  - Replace timeline panel DOM with canvas rendering
  - Fix tool call cleanup leak that caused unbounded object growth after ~5000 events
  - Fix event log cap causing mass event replay in mock/stress mode
  - Cap simulation loop at 60fps to reduce CPU/GPU usage
- Add stress test scenarios for profiling (`?stress=light|medium|heavy|extreme`)
- Add performance overlay for debugging (`?perf`)
- Fix passive event listener warning when panning canvas
- File attention panel: show agent count instead of full name list

## 0.4.7

- Fix: reset button in review mode no longer breaks the extension
  - Active agents are preserved across reset; only completed state and visual history are cleared
  - Event log is trimmed to retain agent_spawn events so review mode seeking works correctly

## 0.4.6

- Updated README: clarified automatic hook configuration behavior
- Updated description and tagline

## 0.4.5

- Initial public release
- Real-time visualization of Claude Code agent execution flows
- Auto-detection of Claude Code sessions via transcript watching
- Claude Code hooks integration for live event streaming
- Multi-session support with session tabs
- Interactive canvas with agent nodes, tool calls, and particles
- Timeline, file attention, and transcript panels
- JSONL event log file watching
